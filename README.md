# Volumio-Presence-Registrator-Plugin
This is a plugin for the Volumio System. It is supposed to be used in a Multiroom-Speaker environment and able to change the volume of the playing music depending on wether a person is inside the room or not (by using two PIR-Motion sensors). It also provides a basic communications framework for a Multiroom scenario, allowing multiple instances on different devices to communicate about the presence status of their room.
